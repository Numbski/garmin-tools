# garmin-tools

A set of "simple" casperjs automation scripts to access and modify features of Garmin Connect that aren't readily available to the end user.

So far I have a utility for reading out the step count, and posting a weight entry.  Still trying to decipher the API for posting body fat, and manipulating the step count, but for now these are two features I needed for automations outside of Garmin Connect.
